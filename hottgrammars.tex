\subsection{Stockholm Math Seminar 2014}

In 2014, Ranta gave an unpublished talk at the Stockholm Mathematics seminar
\cite{aarneHott}. Fortunately the code is available, although many of the design
choices aren't documented in the grammar. This project aimed to provide a
translation like the one desired in our current work, but it took a real piece
of mathematics text as the main influence on the design of the Abstract syntax.

This work took a page of text from Peter Aczel's book which more or less goes
over standard HoTT definitions and theorems, and allows the translation of the
latex to a pidgin logical language. The central motivation of this grammar was
to capture, entirely ``real" natural language mathematics, i.e. that which was
written for the mathematician. Therefore, it isn't reminiscent of the slender
abstract syntax the type theorist adores, and sacrificed ``syntactic
completeness" for ``semantic adequacy". This means that the abstract syntax is
much larger and very expressive, but it no longer becomes easy to reason about
and additionally quite ad-hoc. Another defect is that this grammar
overgenerates, so producing a unique parse from the PL side will become tricky.
Nonetheless, this means that it's presumably possible to carve a subset of the
GF HoTT abstract file to accommodate an Agda program, but one encounters rocks as soon
as one begins to dig. For example, in \autoref{fig:M1} is some rendered latex
taken verbatim from Ranta's test code.

With some of hours of tinkering on the pidgin logic concrete syntax and some
reverse engineering with help from the GF shell, one is able to get these
definitions in \autoref{fig:M2}, which are intended to share the same syntactic
space as cubicalTT. We note the first definition of ``contractability" actually
runs in cubicalTT up to renaming a lexical items, and it is clear that the
translation from that to Agda should be a benign task. However, the
\emph{equivalence} syntax is stuck with the artifact from the bloated abstract
syntax for the of the anaphoric use of ``it", which may presumably be fixed with
a few hours more of tinkering, but becomes even more complicated when not just
defining new types, but actually writing real mathematical proofs, or relatively
large terms. To extend this grammar to accommodate a chapter worth of material,
let alone a book, will not just require extending the lexicon, but encountering
other syntactic phenomena that will further be difficult to compress when
defining Agda's concrete syntax.

\input{latex/ContrClean}

Additionally, we give the Agda code in \autoref{fig:M3}, so-as to see what the
end result of such a program would be. The astute reader will also notice a
semantic in the pidgin rendering error relative to the Agda implementation.
\codeword{fiber} has the type \codeword{it : Set} instead of something like
\codeword{(y : B) : Set}, and the y variable is unbound in the \codeword{fiber}
expression. This demonstrates that to design a grammar prioritizing
\emph{semantic adequacy} and subsequently trying to incorporate \emph{syntactic
completeness} becomes a very difficult problem. Depending on the application of
the grammar, the emphasis on this axis is most assuredly a choice one should
consider up front.

While both these grammars have their strengths and weaknesses, one shall see
shortly that the approach in this thesis, taking an actual programming language
parser in Backus-Naur Form Converter (BNFC), GFifying it, and trying to use the
abstract syntax to model natural language, gives in some sense a dual challenge,
where the abstract syntax remains simple, but its linearizations become
must increase in complexity.

-- Proof using isPropIsContr. This is slow and the direct proof below is better

isPropIsEquiv' : (f : A → B) → isProp (isEquiv f)
equiv-proof (isPropIsEquiv' f u0 u1 i) y =
  isPropIsContr (u0 .equiv-proof y) (u1 .equiv-proof y) i

-- Direct proof that computes quite ok (can be optimized further if
-- necessary, see:

% Example expressions the grammar can parse are seen below, which have been
% verified by hand to be isomorphic to the corresponding cubicaltt BNFC trees:

% \begin{verbatim}

% data bool : Set where true | false
% data nat : Set where zero | suc ( n : nat )
% caseBool ( x : Set ) ( y z : x ) : bool -> Set = split false -> y || true -> z
% indBool ( x : bool -> Set ) ( y : x false ) ( z : x true ) : ( b : bool ) -> x b = split false -> y || true  -> z
% funExt  ( a : Set )   ( b : a -> Set )   ( f g :  ( x : a )  -> b x )   ( p :  ( x : a )  -> ( b x )   ( f x ) == ( g x )  )  : (  ( y : a )  -> b y )  f == g = undefined
% foo ( b : bool ) : bool = b

% \end{verbatim}
