move prior GF Formalizations to a later secion

first half : intro 

second half : grammars

-- include notes in our grammars

Previous Grammars 
Our Grammars 
can reference previous grammars in our grammars (i.e. associativity of add
when discussing associativity proof
p "the sum of the sum of x and y and z is equal to the sum of x and the sum of y and z" gives 32 unique parses
and the normalized forms "the sum of 3 , 4 and 5"(post PGF transformation) o longer conveys the information that makes this a proposition other than x = x "
p "the sum of 3 , 4  and 5 is equal to the sum of 3 , 4 and 5"



in the intro to MLTT. most mathematicians just know the algorithm for adding (e.g. what computer science provides that logic doesn't have), but not the actual 
computational rules as examples of where it differs as well.
comparison of syntaxes like in slides, (copy Aarne's table from cade with FOL and Agda syntax),
comparison of rules as well (for the sake of syntactic difference)
metatheorems in logic (normalization) can be done in type theory as ML did, but the computation rules allow us to do this in a diffent way?
also include HoTT and Cubical intro in this, with the linguistic comparison left for later

GF Section :
give an example of 
concrete vs abstract in both the section on Gf and then reexamined on the section with Sem Ad. and Syn Com.

As expressive adequacy 
the design of a CNL should involve the minimal, such that enough things a mathematician wants to say are able to be said ae sayable in a compehensible way

formal abstacts : include this at the end of the Perspectives section (so we can talk about CNL)

Case study : Corpus Section at the end

apendix : abbreviations

NL generation : cubicalTT 
Start with a syntactically complete grammar and produce a semantically adequate one
PL generation

compare ASTs for different grammars of the same proposition

Possible solutions : write two grammars and connect them via PGF 

so basically, we propose

pgf parsing is difficult according to John, but since this is a simple PL (at least as it stands now) baybe this would be much more feasible, so this could become an obstace if the CNL isn't too restrictive
hs  : HoTT book language (Sem Ad) PGF -> cubicalTT (Synt Com) 
can also look at case studies for the same proof, (for instance, those articulated in the orginal paper) and see how more NL proofs, and the more Linguistic phenomena, 

We seek to use some of the insights in the Logic paper to connect this, like how specific lingusitic phenomena in an extended grammar can be reduced to a core.
computer scientist wants this, 
LPGF : cubicalTT Grammar -> HoTT Grammar
much harder, but also feasible, at least for a CNL subset of NL Grammar. 

This seems feasible for the propositional fragment of NL Mathematics, but certainly not the proof.

--if time/space
Refactor Agda library, with theorem statements and proofs 
Refactor grammars so that they are coherently together 

-- if time/space
Show the difficulty of Awodey's Category theoretic proof of the natural associativity of products 

---------------------------------------

The development of a more extensive parallel corpus would be interesting so these grammars could be written in parallel (not just for ML researchers).  A purely mathematical corpus would also need to be formulated, tagged with syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic phenomena. Additionally, more work to  but especially if it was to be labeled with

I also agree with what they take to be the opposite view, which is presented in Mohan Ganesalingam's monograph The Language of Mathematics (2013). I think that the conflict is to a large extent terminological and has to do with what is meant by pragmatics.}
}

Discuss the pragmatics stuff with respect to natural language generation in general.  A CNL is inductively defined, NL is not. A CNL lacks the pragmatic tools needed to verify or prorduce proofs, but it is feasible that it can be used to at least catalogue mathematical Propositions presented as types.

in some sense, philosophy is baked into Dependent Type Theory (lexically, conceptually, ) in a way that it isn't for classical mathematics. although distinguishing between fields is a recent phenomena


proposition , theorem

have in the judgements section, the definition, proof, corollay, comparison diagram



A formal derivation on its own is a syntactic object but not a proof. Without an interpretation of the language of the formal system the end-formula of the derivation says nothing; and so nothing is proved. Without a demonstration of the system’s soundness with respect to the interpretation, one may lack sufficient reason to believe that all derivable conclusions are true.

-think about this in terms of Pfennings what is logic


Proofs in different PLs survey paper by dutch guy

Which section does this go in? Gangasalingam?


Math : symbolic, vs non-symbolic

Gangesalingam section
Linguists don't just study language is written, but the physical observation of how people speak 
This suggests the mathematical intuitions go much further beyond the invention of the alphabet, and writing in general (symbolism in petroglyphs, writing vs art is indistinguishable anthropologically)

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/8846/proofs-without-words

But this is mathematics as it is written  it's not just symbols

Mathematics may be understood by various audiences 

Mathematicians, Logicians, TTs, Engineers and physicists (who sometimes sacrifice formality for ease of articulation altogether), artists who are only interested in the "semantic side of mathematics" (focused on the pure beauty)  

Non-mathematicians can have deep mathematical intuitions, for instance, a business person could say I want to create a service that does such and such (NL specification that is incredibly vague), and then outsource the work.

Categorical semantics : give a mathematical justification to a PL 
PL implementation of mathematics is the opposite

What does a mathematician mean when they say something is beautiful or ugly - this is presumably a semantic concept
Not at the same way that when a Mathematician hypothetically looks at a sequence of bits, they see anything but noise
But this is the point of doing mathematics, not to generate bits but to decipher beauty 


idea : leave last section for last, so I can work on it for another day or two
