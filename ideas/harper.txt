f ~_A->B g 

f is homotopic to g 

H is evidence for this fact

relation of f being homotopic to g at some type A arrow b 

is defined to be 

Pi x in A , Id_B (f x and g)

Logically

"for every x in a f of x is equal in the sence of B to g of x"

is by definition

Funext ,

happly is defined to be
if you give me a proof that f is equal to g, then they are homotopic

axiom of funext says that this is an equivalence, i.e. 

if you show me that two maps are homotopic, then thats enough to know that they are equal

you can turn the homotopy into a path
o

if f a b is an equivalence then so is f inverse from b to a - given quasi inverse

if _pause_ are equivalences, then so is g after f
if f : A -> B and g : B -> C are equivalences then so is g o f
