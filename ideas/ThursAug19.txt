% for conclusion, as regards group
% A category is equivalently
%     a monad in the 2-category of spans of sets;
%     a monoid in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of objects;
%     a simplicial set which satisfies the Segal conditions;
%     a simplicial set which satisfies the weak Kan complex conditions strictly:
%     hence a directed homotopy type which is “1-truncated”
% this is not our notion,
% it would be absurd to think 

% a monoid is a category with on object
% a monoid is (a monoid in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) with one object 
% a monoid is (a monoid in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) with one object 

% a monoid is (a (a monoid in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) with one object 
% --> a a ungrammatical
% a monoid is ([an?] (a monoid in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) with one object 

% category :=  a simplicial set which satisfies the weak Kan complex conditions strictly:

% group := (a simplicial set which satisfies the weak Kan complex conditions
%   strictly) with one object where every arrow is an isomorphism

% a simplicial set is a contravariant functor from the simplex category to the
%   category of sets

% a simplicial set which satisfies the Segal conditions;

% category of sets := simplicial set[s] which satisfies the Segal conditions;
% whose 

% groupoid with a single object, or more precisely a pointed groupoid with a single object.

% a group is a record type such that...
% substitute infinity-groupoid in for type
% a group is (give a signature) 
% a group is a record type such that...

Idea : one can define incredibly general structures such that everything is
