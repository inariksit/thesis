% for conclusion, as regards group
% A category is equivalently
%     a monad in the 2-category of spans of sets;
%     a monoid in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of objects;
%     a simplicial set which satisfies the Segal conditions;
%     a simplicial set which satisfies the weak Kan complex conditions strictly:
%     hence a directed homotopy type which is “1-truncated”
% this is not our notion,
% it would be absurd to think 

% joke from Wadler, a monad is just a monoid in the monoidal category of endofucntors

% a monoid is a category with on object
% a monoid is (a monoid in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) with one object 
% a monoid is (a monoid in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) with one object 

% a monoid is (a (a monoid in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) with one object 
% --> a a ungrammatical
% a monoid is ([an?] (a monoid in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) in the monoidal category of endospans on the set of
%   objects) with one object 

% how does this look in type theory , if, for instance, one chooses to define it as this a special case of this very very general thing
% monoid = monoid in = monoid object in  ...
% monoid doesn't equal 

% intensionally very different, even if extensionally equal

% category :=  a simplicial set which satisfies the weak Kan complex conditions strictly:

% group := (a simplicial set which satisfies the weak Kan complex conditions
%   strictly) with one object where every arrow is an isomorphism
% definitional substution works in type theory,  but does it really work for NL mathematics? i.e. does one say (one object) for a functor. what does it mean in this case

% a simplicial set is a contravariant functor from the simplex category to the
%   category of sets

% are these just inductive recursive definitions ?  ask peter dybjer

% a simplicial set which satisfies the Segal conditions;

% category of sets := simplicial set[s] which satisfies the Segal conditions;
% whose 

% groupoid with a single object, or more precisely a pointed groupoid with a single object.

% a group is a record type such that...
% substitute infinity-groupoid in for type
% a group is (give a signature) 
% a group is a record type such that...

% Idea : one can define incredibly general structures such that everything is an example of this, or an exaple of this subject to some conditions, but doesn't this collapse?

Wittgenstein : a dictionary is not a closed system because all the words refer to themselves.  Maybe it

one can look at the trace of a dictionary defined word

functor with one map 

also, Bauer, where one talks about groups with signature, and then says a group is just a model of the o

Example 1.12. A model G of Group, cf. Example 1.2, is given by a carrier set |G| and
maps
[[u]]G : 1 → |G|,
 [[m]]G : |G| × |G| → |G|,
 [[i]]G : |G| → |G|,
interpreting the operation symbols u, m, and i, respectively, such that the equations EGroup .
This amounts precisely to (|G|, [[u]]G , [[m]]G , [[i]]G ) being a group, except that the unit is
viewed as a map 1 → |G| instead of an element of |G|.
