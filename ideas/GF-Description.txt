Personal perspectives on GF

A GF AST can be seen as a uniquely similar definition to that of an operad, and it should be noted that the insights and general way of thinking that an Operad gives about a subject.  



* Compositionality 
* Modularity
* Abstraction

Both of these principles are centrail concerns when understanding how to think about and effectively use GF, for exploiting these correctly is both rewarding and tricky.  


We begin with an overall perspective on the what when why and how for GF 

what
- What is the semantic, or ontological domain I'm trying to model

What are the languages which map to that domain?
What are their building blocks and ways, or instructions, for assembling those building blocks.
What are different ways of saying the same thing in a given language.
Which principles or features of one language are shared in how they express 
How do I map those building blocks into different languages?
What are the most important features of the languages in terms of ?
How ambiguous are the languages ? 


Building blocks = Categories
Instructions = functions
Assembly instructions = compositions of functions
