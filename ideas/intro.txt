Hegel Quote, phenomenology of the spirit

Sweden, svenska, and Martin-Lof's style of presenting type theory, down to the meaning explanations.

What work was done during this thesis accomplishes

There is the obvious work which is expressed in this thesis.  

But with everything, there is a lot that maybe wasn't able to be expressed here.

Ambitions were overly optimisitic

- Learning Agda, Coq, and even some time playing with Lean (because it targets real mathematicians)

- Trying to learn what it means to formalize mathematics with various case studies

- Lots of discussions with various people (Dybjer, Angelov, Robin Cooper, Per) ITC people

Thinking about GF and how to interpret it mathematically


Mathematicians : 
Logicians :
Deeper issues of the internal meaning of mathematics and its relation to us neurologically, socialogically, historically, (for decades and centuries to come) will also hopefully see work from this thesis
