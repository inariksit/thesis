\subsection{Agda}

\subsubsection{Overview}

Agda is an attempt to faithfully formalize Martin-Löf's intensional type theory
\cite{ml1984} into a functional programming language . One can think of
Martin-Löf's original work as a specification of a foundational system, and Agda
as one possible implementation.

Through an interactive environment, Agda allows one to iteratively apply rules
and develop constructive mathematics. It's current incarnation, Agda2 (but just
called Agda), was preceded by ALF, Cayenne, and Alfa, and Agda1. In addition to
the core MLTT, Agda incorporates dependent records, inductive definitions with
all types of bells and whistles, pattern matching, a versatile module system,
and a myriad of other features which are of interest generally but not relevant
to this work.

We will only look at what can in some sense be seen as the kernel of Agda.
Developing a full-blown GF grammar to incorporate more advanced Agda features
would require efforts beyond the scope of this work. And while there are still
many reasons one may wish to use other programming languages, there is a sense
of purity one gets when writing Agda code. There are many good resources for
learning Agda \cite{Bove2009} \cite{stump} \cite{ulf} \cite{wadler} so we'll
only give a cursory overview of what is relevant for this thesis, with a
particular emphasis on the syntax.
