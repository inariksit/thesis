\section{Natural Number Proofs}

We now explore the kernel of this work : proofs. Here we open with the perhaps
the most natural kind of proof one would expect, that of laws over the
inductively defined natural numbers. As a proposed foundational alternative to
mathematics, dependent type theories allow types to depend on
