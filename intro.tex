\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The central concern of this thesis is the syntax of mathematics, programming
languages, and their respective mutual influence, as conceived and practiced by
mathematicians and computer scientists.  From one vantage point, the role of
syntax in mathematics may be regarded as a 2nd order concern, a topic for
discussion during a Fika, an artifact of ad hoc development by the working
mathematician whose real goals are producing genuine mathematical knowledge.
For the programmers and computer scientists, syntax may be regarding as a
matter of taste, with friendly debates recurring regarding the use of
semicolons, brackets, and white space.  Yet, when viewed through the lens of
the propositions-as-types paradigm, these discussions intersect in new and
interesting ways.  When one introduces a third paradigm through which to
analyze the use of syntax in mathematics and programming, namely linguistics, I
propose what some may regard as superficial detail, indeed becomes a central
paradigm raising many interesting and important questions. 


\subsection{Beyond Computational Trinitarianism}

\begin{displayquote}

The doctrine of computational trinitarianism holds that computation manifests
itself in three forms: proofs of propositions, programs of a type, and mappings
between structures. These three aspects give rise to three sects of worship:
Logic, which gives primacy to proofs and propositions; Languages, which gives
primacy to programs and types; Categories, which gives primacy to mappings and
structures.\cite{harperTrinity}
\end{displayquote}

We begin this discussion of the three relationships between three respective
fields, mathematics, computer science, and logic. The aptly named 
trinity, shown in \autoref{fig:M1}, are related via both \emph{formal} and \emph{informal}
methods. The propositions as types paradigm, for example, is a heuristic. Yet
it also offers many examples of successful ideas translating between the domains.
Alternatively, the interpretation of a Type Theory(TT) into a category theory is
incredibly \emph{formal}.

We hope this thesis will help clarify another possible dimension in this
diagram, that of Linguistics, and call it the ``holy tetrahedron". The different
vertices also resemble
religions in their own right, with communities convinced that they have a
canonical perspective on foundations and the essence of mathematics. Questioning the holy trinity is an act of a heresy, and
it is the goal of this thesis to be a bit heretical by including a much less well understood 
perspective which provides additional challenges and
insights into the trinity.

One may see how the trinity give rise to \emph{formal} semantic interpretations
of natural language in \autoref{fig:M2}. Semantics is just one possible
linguistic phenomenon worth investigating in these domains, and could be
replaced by other linguistic paradigms. This thesis is alternatively concerned
with syntax.

Finally, as in \autoref{fig:M3}, we can ask : how does the trinity embed into
natural language? These are the most \emph{informal} arrows of tetrahedron, or
at least one reading of it. One can analyze mathematics using linguistic
methods, or try to give a natural language justification of Intuitionistic Type
Theory (ITT) using Martin-LÃ¶f's meaning explanations.

In this work, we will see that there are multiple GF grammars which model some
subset of each member of the trinity. Constructing these grammars, and asking
how they can be used in applications for mathematicians, logicians, and computer
scientists is an important practical and philosophical question. Therefore we
hope this attempt at giving the language of mathematics, in particular how
propositions and proofs are expressed and thought about in that language, a
stronger foundation.

\subsection{What is a Homomorophism?}

To get a feel for the syntactic paradigm we explore in this thesis, let us look at a basic mathematical
example: that of a group homomorphism as expressed in by a variety of somewhat
randomly sampled authors.  

% Wikipedia Defn:

\begin{definition}
In mathematics, given two groups, $(G, \ast)$ and $(H, \cdot)$, a group homomorphism from $(G, \ast)$ to $(H, \cdot)$ is a function $h : G \to H$ such that for all $u$ and $v$ in $G$ it holds that
  $$h(u \ast v) = h ( u ) \cdot h ( v )$$ 
\end{definition}

% http://math.mit.edu/~jwellens/Group%20Theory%20Forum.pdf

\begin{definition}
Let $G = (G,\cdot)$ and $G' = (G',\ast)$ be groups, and let $\phi : G \to G'$ be a map between them. We call $\phi$ a \textbf{homomorphism} if for every pair of elements $g, h \in G$, we have 
% \begin{center}
  $$\phi(g \ast h) = \phi ( g ) \cdot \phi ( h )$$ 
% \end{center}
\end{definition}

% http://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~mwemyss/teaching/3alg1-7.pdf

\begin{definition}\label{def:def3}
Let $G$, $H$, be groups.  A map $\phi : G \to H$ is called a \emph{group homomorphism} if
  $$\phi(xy) = \phi ( x ) \phi ( y )$ for all $x, y \in G$$ 
(Note that $xy$ on the left is formed using the group operation in $G$, whilst the product $\phi ( x ) \phi ( y )$ is formed using the group operation $H$.)
\end{definition}

% NLab:

\begin{definition}\label{def:def4}
Classically, a group is a monoid in which every element has an inverse (necessarily unique).
\end{definition}

We inquire the reader to pay attention to nuance and difference in presentation
that is normally ignored or taken for granted by the fluent mathematician, ask
which definitions feel better, and how the reader herself might present the
definition differently.

If one want to distill the meaning of each of these presentations, there is a
significant amount of subliminal interpretation happening very much analogous to
our innate lingusitic ussage. The inverse and identity are discarded, even
though they are necessary data when defning a group. The order of presentation
of information is inconsistent, as well as the choice to use symbolic or natural
language information. In Definition~\ref{def:def3}, the group operation is used
implicitly, and its clarification a side remark.

Details aside, these all mean the same thing - don't they?  This thesis seeks to provide an
abstract framework to determine whether two lingusitically nuanced presenations
mean the same thing via their syntactic transformations. Obviously these
meanings  are not resolvable in any kind of absolute sense, but at least from a
translational sense. These syntactic transformations come in two flavors : parsing and
linearization, and are natively handled by a Logical Framework (LF) for
specifying grammars : Grammatical Framework (GF).

We now show yet another definition of a group homomorphism formalized in the
Agda programming language:

\input{latex/monoid}
While the last two definitions may carry degree of comprehension to a programmer
or mathematician not exposed to Agda, it is certainly comprehensible to a
computer : that is, it typechecks on a computer where Cubical Agda is installed.
While GF is designed for multilingual syntactic transformations and is targeted
for natural language translation, it's underlying theory is largely based on
ideas from the compiler communities. A cousin of the BNF Converter (BNFC), GF is
fully capable of parsing programming languages like Agda! And while the Agda
definitions are just another concrete syntactic presentation of a group
homomorphism, they are distinct from the natural language presentations above in
that the colors indicate it has indeed type checked.

While this example may not exemplify the power of Agda's type-checker, it is of
considerable interest to many. The type-checker has merely assured us that
\term{GroupHom(')} are well-formed types - not that we have a canonical representation
of a group homomorphism. The type-checker is much more useful than is
immediately evident: it delegates the work of verifying that a proof is correct,
that is, the work of judging whether a term has a type, to the computer. While
it's of practical concern is immediate to any exploited grad student grading
papers late on a Sunday night, its theoretical concern has led to many recent
developments in modern mathematics. Thomas Hales solution to the Kepler
Conjecture was seen as unverifiable by those reviewing it, and this led to Hales
outsourcing the verification to Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) HOL Light and
Isabelle. This computer delegated verification phase led to many minor
corrections in the original proof which were never spotted due to human
oversight.

Fields medalist Vladimir Voevodsky had the experience of being told one day
his proof of the Milnor conjecture was fatally flawed. Although the leak in the
proof was patched, this experience of temporarily believing much of his life's
work invalidated led him to investigate proof assintants as a tool for future
thought. Indeed, this proof verification error was a key event that led to the
Univalent Foundations
Project~\cite{theunivalentfoundationsprogram-homotopytypetheory-2013}.

While Agda and other programming languages are capable of encoding definitions,
theorems, and proofs, they have so far seen little adoption. In some cases they
have been treated with suspicion and scorn by many mathematicians. This isn't
entirely unfounded : it's a lot of work to learn how to use Agda or Coq,
software updates may cause proofs to break, and the inevitable imperfections we
humans are prone to instilled in these tools . Besides, Martin-LÃ¶f Type Theory,
the constructive foundational project which underlies these proof assistants, is
often misunderstood by those who dogmatically accept the law of the excluded
middle as the word of God.

It should be noted, the constructivist rejects neither the law of the excluded
middle, nor ZFC. She merely observes them, and admits their handiness in certain
citations. Excluded middle is indeed a helpful tool as many mathematicians
may attest. The contention is that it should be avoided whenever possible -
proofs which don't rely on it, or it's corallary of proof by contradction, are
much more ameanable to formalization in systems with decideable type checking.
And ZFC, while serving the mathematicians of the early 20th century, is 
lacking when it comes to the higher dimensional structure of n-categories and
infinity groupoids.

What these theorem provers give the mathematician is confidence that her work
is correct, and even more importantly, that the work which she takes for
granted and references in her work is also correct. The task before us is then
one of religious conversion. And one doesn't undertake a conversion by simply
by preaching. Foundational details aside, this thesis is meant to provide a
blueprint for the syntactic reformation that must take place.  

We don't insist a mathematician relinquish the beautiful language she has
come to love in expressing her ideas.  Rather, it asks her to make a
hypothetical compromise
for the time being, and use a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) to develop her
work. In exchange she'll get the confidence that Agda provides. Not only that,
she'll be able to search through a library, to see who else has possibly
already postulated and proved her conjecture. A version of this grandiose vision is 
explored in The Formal Abstracts Project \cite{halesCNL}, and it should
practically motivate work.  

Practicalities aside, this work also attempts to offer a nuanced philosophical
perspective on the matter by exploring why translation of mathematical language,
despite it's seemingly structured form, is difficult. We note that the natural
language definitions of monoid differ in form, but also in pragmatic content.
How one expresses formalities in natural language is incredibly diverse, and
Definition~\ref{def:def4} as compared with the prior homomorphism definitions is
particularly poignant in demonstrating this. These differ very much in nature to
the Agda definitions - especially pragmatically. The differences between the Cubical
Agda definitions may be loosely called pragmatic, in the sense that the choice
of definitions may have downstream effects on readability, maintainability, modularity, and other
considerations when trying to write good code, in a burgeoning area known as proof engineering.

A pragmatic treatment of the language of mathematics is the golden egg if one
wishes to articulate the nuance in how the notions proposition, proof, and
judgment are understood by humans. Nonetheless, this problem is just now seeing
attention. We hope that the treatment of syntax in this thesis, while a long
ways away from giving a pragmatic account of mathematics, will help pave the way
there.
